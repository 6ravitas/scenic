  ## Overview

  The job of the `ViewPort` is to coordinate the flow of information between
  the scenes and the drivers. Scene's and Drivers should not know anything
  about each other. An app should work identically from it's point of view
  no matter if there is one, multiple, or no drivers currently running.

  Drivers are all about rendering output and collecting input from a single
  source. Usually hardware, but can also be the network or files. Drivers
  only care about graphs and should not need to know anything about the
  logic or state encapsulated in Scenes.

  The goal is to isolate app data & logic from render data & logic. The
  ViewPort is the chokepoint between them that makes sense of the flow
  of information.

  ## OUTPUT

  Practically speaking, the `ViewPort` is the owner of the ETS tables that
  carry the graphs (and any other necessary support info). If the VP
  crashes, then all that information needs to be rebuilt. The VP monitors
  all running scenes and does the appropriate cleanup when any of them
  goes DOWN.

  The scene is responsible for generating graphs and writing them to
  the graph ETS table. (Also tried casting the graph to the ViewPort
  so that the table could be non-public, but that had issues)

  The drivers should only read from the graph tables.

  ## INPUT

  When user input happens, the drivers send it to the `ViewPort`.
  Input that does not depend on screen position (key presses, audio
  window events, etc...) Are sent to the root scene unless some other
  scene has captured that type of input (see captured input) below.

  If the input event does depend on positino (cursor position, cursor
  button presses, scrolling, etc...) then the ViewPort needs to
  travers the hierarchical graph of graphs, to find the corrent
  scene, and the item in that scene that was "hit". The ViewPort
  then sends the event to that scene, with the position projected
  into the scene's local coordinate space (via the built-up stack
  of matrix transformations)

  ## CAPTURED INPUT

  A scene can request to "capture" all input events of a certain type.
  this means that all events of that type are sent to a certain
  scene process regardless of position or root. In this way, a
  text input scene nested deep in the tree can capture key presses.
  Or a button can capture cursor_pos events after it has been pressed.

  if a scene has "captured" a position dependent input type, that
  position is projected into the scene's coordinate space before
  sending the event. Note that instead of walking the graph of graphs,
  the transforms provided in the input "context" field are used. You
  could, in theory change that to something else before capturing,
  but I wouldn't really recommend it.

  Any scene can cancel the current capture. This would probably
  leave the scene that thinks it has "captured" the input in a
  weird state, so I wouldn't recommend it.
